Basic config for my swayfx setup

Basic requirements:
- alacritty (as of my main terminal)
- nerd fonts (ubuntu-nerd-font)
- waybar, mako, rofi
- fish and starship (you can use whatevery you want)
- materia-gtk-transparent-theme (on github)

Make sure to check my config files. My waybar includes a powermenu binary file and a network manager binary file (clickable to launch a interactive rofi based session)
